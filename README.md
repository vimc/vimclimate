Jameel Institute packages are based.

To use this template, select *ji.rpkg.template* from the drop-down menu

Jameel Institute organisation. Replace all instances of
“ji.rpkg.template” with your package name. Make sure to also:

1.  Edit the `DESCRIPTION` as appropriate with the correct package
    information;

2.  Edit the files in `R/`, `tests/`, and `vignettes/` to suit your
    package;

3.  Remove these instructions from `README.Rmd`, and re-render the `.md`
    file using `devtools::render_readme()`.
