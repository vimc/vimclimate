This is a special vignette, which shares the same name as the package.
It will render as the "Get started" page in the navigation bar of _pkgdown_ websites.

To develop it further:

1. Rename the file to your package name;

2. Add code and explainers to help users get started with using your package in this vignette;

3. Remember to add and link references if needed.
