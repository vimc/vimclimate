_vimclimate_ is an R package that helps access pre-made climatic variable time-series data for use in modelling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of _vimclimate_ from the [VIMC R-universe](https://vimc.r-universe.dev/) with:

```r
installation from R-universe
install.packages(
  "vimclimate", 
  repos = c(
    "https://vimc.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

or from GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the _pak_ package:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("vimc/vimclimate")
```

## Quick start
